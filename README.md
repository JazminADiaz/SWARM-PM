# SWARM-PM
This is SWARM-PM a new method to analyze and model swarm robot missions!

In the reposiroty files you'll find a .ipynb script, from there you can run a simulation for two scenarios scenario A is in the file tuttiTamT.argos and scenario B is in tuttiTamT2.argos

The missions you can run deppend on you! you'll find a random generator or a manual one, you can use either, is up to you.

You can also comment out the simulation part if you already have an event log, make sure it is avalaible on a CSV format and you'll be good.

To access scenario A and B, epuck robots and its controler, you'll need to download ARGoS3 (a robot simulator) and TuttiFrutti (control software) with the changes we implemented for Swarm-PM.

The step by step instructions are available in the instructions.sh file
